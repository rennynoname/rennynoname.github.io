      <p>Hi! My name is Alida Angafor, I am 25 and currently living in Salida Colorado. Before moving to Salida, 
        I was living in Durango, where I worked with Southwest Conservation Corp in the summer and fall and then 
        worked at the Boys and Girls Club and the local ski resort there in the winter. I intended to stay there 
        only for the summer when I first moved there, but I loved the people and place so much that I ended up 
        staying there for about a year. Would have stayed longer, but had to move to Salida when I was offered 
        a position here with the Department of Human Services as a caseworker with the child welfare division. 
        I have only been here a couple of months, since April, but I can say with absolute certainty that it has 
        definitely been quite an experience, to say the least. I do enjoy the work. Sure, working with families 
        to ensure the safety of vulnerable populations such as children who are often overlooked in the place I 
        am from is very rewarding and healing in some ways, but it is also just nice feeling like a part of things. 
        It feels nice not having to work as hard as I have had to in the past just to feel tethered, these days I 
        just am.</p>

        <p>Anyway before Durango and Salida, I spent about six months traveling in South America and about two 
          months traveling in Europe. I started in Chile and traveling primarily by bus, I made my way to 
          Columbia. Along the way, I worked in hostels and communes. From Columbia, I flew to Portugal and 
          traveling solely by train made my way across Western Europe. My trip ended in Turkey from where 
          I flew back to the United States. Traveling for eight months was fun and liberating, lonely at 
          times sure and even tiring, but it was also just a necessary thing I needed to do.  Before I 
          decided to go traveling, I think I was at the lowest I had ever been. I was living in Hilo, Hawaii 
          at the time, working as a program guide with pacific quest horticultural therapy program, which is 
          a residential program for troubled teens and young adults. I went to work and did the bare minimum 
          I needed to do to not be homeless, but outside of that, I did nothing else. I had little to no interest 
          in getting to know anyone or do anything, life simply did not excite me. I remember spending hours 
          crying in my cute little studio apartment by the river, which in hindsight cost way too much. 
          I was miserable, in truth I had been miserable for the longest time. I saw a therapist who told me 
          that I had persistent depressive disorder also known as dysthymia. He also did tell me that he did not think I was 
          clinically depressed but he thought I was philosophically depressed, I don't entirely understand what that means, but  I thought was hilarious. I had 
          quite literally thought myself into depression it seemed, I mean that is kind of funny. Anyway, I do 
          not know when the decision was made, but after about six months in Hawaii, I decided I was going to 
          go traveling. I booked a flight to Chile, packed a backpack, sold everything else and well the rest 
          is history.</p>
        
      <p>Prior to Hawaii and traveling and everything else, I worked in Utah as a program guide at a therapy 
        program for troubled teenage boys. Before that, I was in college. I graduated in 2021 with a bachelor 
        degree in philosophy and sociology and a minor in astronomy. I am sure I will get around to reflecting 
        on the whole college experience at some point. I went to high school in Washington, DC, and attended 
        middle school, elementary school, and kindergarten in Cameroon, which is where I was born. I barely 
        think of Cameroon these days, but it remains to be a significant part of who I am. I have not been 
        there in over twelve years, but I would like to go back someday. I have a lot of family there. 
        My father is there, but I do not really talk to him, he pissed me off many years ago and I suppose 
        I am not over it just yet. I may or may not get around to writing more on that someday.</p>
        
      <p>What I mainly hope to write about is my experience of the world from my standpoint. Don't ask me 
        why because I got no good reasons. I Just like writing, I have wanted to start a blog like this for 
        a long time and am just glad to be finally doing it.  </p>
