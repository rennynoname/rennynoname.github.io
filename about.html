           <p>Hi! My name is Alida Angafor, I am 25 and currently living in Salida Colorado. Before moving to Salida, 
            I was living in Durango, where I worked with Southwest Conservation Corp in the summer and fall and then 
            worked at the Boys and Girls Club and the local ski resort there, purgatory, in the winter. I intended to 
            stay there only for the summer when I first moved there, but I loved the people and place so much that I 
            ended up staying there for about a year. Would have stayed longer, but had to move to Salida when I was 
            offered a position with the Department of Human Services here in Salida as a caseworker with the child 
            welfare division. I have only been here a couple of months, since April, but I can say with absolute 
            certainty that it has definitely been quite an experience, to say the least. I do enjoy the work. Sure, 
            working with families to ensure the safety of vulnerable populations such as children who are often 
            overlooked in the place I am from is very rewarding for sure and healing in some ways, but it is also 
            just nice feeling like a part of things. It feels nice not having to work as hard as I have had to in 
            the past just to feel tethered to society and people, these days I just am part of things.</p>

            <p>Before Durango and Salida, I spent about six months traveling in South America and about two months 
            traveling in Europe. I started in Chile and traveling primarily by bus made my way to Columbia. Along 
            the way, I worked in hostels and communes while experiencing the many cultures that constitute South 
            America. From Columbia, I flew to Portugal and traveling solely by train made my way across Western 
            Europe. My trip ended in Turkey from where I flew back to the United States. Traveling for eight 
            months was fun and liberating, lonely at times sure and even tiring, but it was also just a necessary 
            thing I needed to do. Before I decided to go traveling, I think I was at the lowest I had ever been. 
            I was living in Hilo, Hawaii at the time, working as a program guide with pacific quest horticultural 
            therapy program, which is a residential program for troubled teens and young adults. I went to work 
            and did the bare minimum I needed to do to not be homeless, but outside of that I did nothing else. 
            I had little to no interest in getting to know anyone or do anything, life simply did not excite me. 
            I remember spending hours crying in my cute little studio apartment by the river, which in hindsight 
            cost way too much. I was miserable in paradise. I saw a therapist who told me that I had persistent 
            depressive disorder also known as dysthymia. He told me he did not think I was clinically depressed 
            but thought I was philosophically depressed which I thought was hilarious, I had quite literally 
            thought myself into depression, I mean that is kind of funny. Anyway, I don not know when the decision 
            was made, but after about six months in Hawaii, I decided I was going to go traveling. I booked a 
            flight to Chile, packed a backpack, sold everything else and well the rest is history.</p>
            
          <p>Prior to Hawaii and traveling and everything else, I worked in Utah as a program guide at a 
            therapy program for troubled teenage boys. Before that, I was in college. I graduated in 2021 
            with a bachelor degree in philosophy and sociology and a minor in astronomy. I am sure I will 
            get around to reflecting on the whole college experience at some point. I went to high school 
            in Washington, DC, and attended middle, elementary, and kindergarten in Cameroon, which is where 
            I was born. I barely think of Cameroon these days, but it remains to be a significant part of 
            who I am. I have not been there in over twelve years, but I would like to go back someday, I have 
            a lot of family there. My father is there, but I don not really talk to him, he pissed me off many 
            years ago and I suppose I am not over it just yet. I did try to reach out to him when I lived in 
            Hawaii, but he tried guilt-tripping me, which just pissed me off, so I blocked him. I may or may 
            not get around to writing more on that someday.</p>
            
          <p>What I mainly hope to write about is my experience of the world from my standpoint. But also just 
            reflections and interpretations of ideas and whatnot. Every now and then I would read a book or watch 
            a movie that presents ideas that have my brain scrambled for days and I suppose it would be nice having 
            a space to untangle those ideas through writing. I hope to begin the endeavor of attaining a master's 
            in philosophy soon, so I will also be sharing any papers I write here as well. I have wanted to create 
            a website like this for the longest time, so just glad to be finally doing it. </p>
